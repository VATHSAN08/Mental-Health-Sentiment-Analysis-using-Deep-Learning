## Project Overview

Mental health is a critical aspect of overall well-being. This project focuses on classifying sentiments from text related to mental health issues. By using a fine-tuned RoBERTa model, we aim to detect emotions and sentiments effectively. This can help in providing timely support and resources to individuals in need.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VATHSAN08/Mental-Health-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Deep-Learning.git
   cd Mental-Health-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Deep-Learning
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Dataset**:
   The dataset is available in the `data` folder. Ensure that you have the necessary files before proceeding.

4. **Run the Application**:
   You can run the main script using:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Technologies Used

This project employs a variety of technologies and libraries, including:

- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: PyTorch
- **Natural Language Processing**: NLTK, SpaCy
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Modeling**: RoBERTa, Logistic Regression
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git

## Data Exploration and Analysis

Understanding the data is crucial for building an effective model. In this project, we conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize and understand the distribution of sentiments. 

### Key Steps in EDA:

- **Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicates, handle missing values.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
- **Sentiment Distribution**: Visualize the distribution of different sentiments.

You can find the EDA process in the Jupyter notebook located in the `notebooks` folder.

## Model Training

The core of this project revolves around training the RoBERTa model. Here‚Äôs how the training process works:

1. **Data Preparation**: Split the data into training and validation sets.
2. **Model Configuration**: Define the architecture and hyperparameters.
3. **Training Loop**: Train the model using the training set while validating on the validation set.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and F1 score.

For detailed implementation, check the `model.py` file in the `src` directory.

## Usage

After training the model, you can use it to predict sentiments on new text data. Here‚Äôs a simple example:

```python
from src.model import load_model, predict_sentiment

model = load_model('path_to_model')
text = "I feel overwhelmed and anxious."
sentiment = predict_sentiment(model, text)
print(f"The sentiment is: {sentiment}")
```
