# Mental-Health-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Deep-Learning (RoBERTa)

## Project Overview

In a world where digital communication is increasingly prevalent, understanding and addressing mental well-being is paramount. This project, stands as a testament to our commitment to fostering a more empathetic and supportive online environment. It's not just about algorithms; it's about leveraging the power of AI to listen, understand, and ultimately, contribute to a kinder digital space.

At its heart, this initiative compassionately applies deep learning to classify mental health-related sentiments from textual data. By utilizing the robust RoBERTa model, this notebook meticulously analyzes textual expressions to identify various mental health sentiments such as Anxiety, Depression, Stress, Suicidal ideation, Bipolar disorder, and Personality disorder, alongside a 'Normal' category for general sentiments. Our goal is to provide a tool that can help in early detection and understanding, paving the way for timely support and intervention, and reminding us that behind every screen, there's a human story.
